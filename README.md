## 🧠 Best Practices with Copilot & Firebase Studio

### 1. Be Specific
> Precise prompts yield better results.
- ❌ *"Make UI better"*  
- ✅ *"Arrange calendar left and habit list/form right in two-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile."*

### 2. Iterate Frequently
Copilot works best in a feedback loop:  
**Prompt → Review → Refine → Repeat**

### 3. Understand Copilot
- **Strengths**: UI scaffolding, validation, boilerplate logic, debug assistance.
- **Limitations**: Needs guidance on architecture and complex logic.

### 4. Debug Smart
Provide the exact console/build error messages.  
Copilot can often resolve JSX errors, hydration issues, etc.

### 5. Review All Code
Never skip review. Copilot is a helper — not a substitute for good engineering practices.

### 6. Organize Your Code
Name files clearly (`.tsx` for JSX), keep modules clean, import/export properly. Copilot relies on this context.

### 7. Rapid Prototyping
Copilot is ideal for fast iteration: build, test, revise, discard.
